    "This Python script primarily serves the purpose of scraping data related to UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) fights from a website called \"bestfightodds.com\". It makes use of libraries such as Pandas, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium to perform actions such as data manipulation, html parsing, and simulating browser interactions, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "The program operates in this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It begins by importing the necessary libraries for the tasks and setting the working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It reads event data from an existing CSV file (\"Final_Hand_Done_BFO_Urls_with UFC_Stats_Urls.csv\") located in the set directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The script pulls event URLs from the loaded file and prepares a list of all unique URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The program verifies these URLs against the completed UFC events on the UFC stats website. If it finds new events that haven't been accounted for in the initial CSV, it identifies these events, and it fetches their corresponding URLs from \"bestfightodds.com\" using a Google search.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. If encountering issues while fetching these URLs, the program flags these errors and, depending on the problem, it may require human interference to resolve the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. For each event, the program downloads odds information by sending GET requests to the corresponding URL. The script uses user-agent headers with these requests to prevent them from being blocked. The scraped data is then processed and added to a Pandas DataFrame for data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. After gathering data for all the URLs, the bot attempts to download all the odds change data. It accomplishes this by using the Selenium WebDriver to imitate browser interactions for each URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. After collecting all data, the script summarizes the data acquisition process. It saves all the gathered data into CSV files for subsequent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also important to note that the script is written in such a way to handle errors and exceptions. If the operation fails at any point, it captures essential failure information and proceeds with the next iterations. This handling lets the user debug the issue, making the script more robust and reliable for future execution."
