    "This code involves both web scraping and data manipulation. It obtains data from the official UFC website and performs certain steps to transform it into a format useful for data analysis or machine learning. Here is a breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importing Necessary Libraries**: The script starts by importing necessary Python packages and setting some configurations. Packages include pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization, BeautifulSoup and requests for web scraping, and a few others.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Directory Settings**: Sets the working directory where data will be fetched and stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Loading Dataset**: Loads a CSV file called \"All_Fight_Totals.csv\" which seems to have data about the fights and fighter names.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Preparing Fighter Names**: Lists out unique fighter names, removes duplicates and forms URLs to each fighter's bio page on the UFC website.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Scrapping Bio Data**: A function `get_ufc_bios` is defined to scrape biography data of each fighter from their bio page. This function fetches the webpage, extracts desired information - labels and corresponding bio details - and forms a data frame out of it. Bio data for each fighter is stored separately in a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Handling Push Errors**: If the data fetching process encounters any errors, the urls causing errors are stored in a separate CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Fetching Missing Bio Data**: Defines another function 'download_missing_bios'. This function first identifies bios that are missing or caused errors. After that, it attempts to download missing bios again.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Consolidating the Data**: After all available bios are downloaded, it loads all CSV files containing each fighter's bio data and combines them into a master dataset/dataframe. Finally, it outputs the resulting combined dataframe into a CSV file called \"All_Fighter_Bios.csv\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This script efficiently collects the bio data of all fighters listed in the UFC and compiles it into a single unified CSV file, ready for data analysis or model building activities."
